# 🚀 Full Stack CI/CD Pipeline Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up a complete end-to-end CI/CD pipeline for a FastAPI + Node.js full-stack application. The repository includes options for AWS (original), but this project has been adapted to support **Azure** student accounts.

See the repository `SETUP.md` for full instructions. The top-level `SETUP.md` has been preserved as a reference but documentation has been moved here for clarity.

**Azure-specific instructions:** see `docs/AZURE.md` for step-by-step guidance on deploying the frontend to **Azure Static Web Apps**.
